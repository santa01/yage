System requirements
===================

* GNU/Linux distribution with C++11 compatible compiler
    * gcc 4.3 is minimum requirement
    * gcc 4.7+ is recommended
* CMake, version 2.8+
* Support for OpenGL 3.3
* GLX 1.4 or higher


Build-time dependencies
=======================

* CMake
* X11 development headers
* XrandR development headers
* OpenGL development headers
* Doxygen (optional)
* Graphviz (optional)


Building
========

CMake build system prohibits building in source root. Typical build sequence
will look like this:

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr /path/to/yage/sources

For bumblebee users it would be better to link against nVidia's libGL.so:

    $ cmake -DYAGE_OPENGL=/usr/lib/nvidia-current/libGL.so ${OTHER_OPTIONS} /path/to/yage/sources

Build the project:

    $ make

Make documentation (Doxygen is required, Graphviz is optional):

    $ make docs


Installing
==========

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX parameter determines install prefix where binaries
(e.g. ./lib/libyage.so) will be installed.

You can either make package for your system package manager

    $ make package

or install it using traditional way

    $ make install
